    "# Setting up your Jupyter Notebook on AWS\n",
    "So you want to setup your Jupyter notebooks on the cloud?\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial in 4 parts will guide through the process of:\n",
    "1. Setting up your EC2 instance\n",
    "2. Generating your security certificate\n",
    "3. Updating your EC2 box\n",
    "4. Configuring your Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sign-in to aws.amazon.com\n",
    "You will need to create an amazon aws account. If this is the first time that you have registered for AWS services then lucky you! AWS offers a free-tier for the first year to run AWS services (as of the time of this writing - February 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is EC2?\n",
    "EC2 stands for Elastic Cloud Compute and is Amazon Web Services virtual compute environment. It's an on demand service that allows you to provision virtual computers. That is IAAS or infrastructure as a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up your EC2 Instance\n",
    "_These instructions are the same for Windows, Mac, Ubuntu and Linux users._\n",
    "Here are the steps you will need to follow to set up your EC2 instance with Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "1. Services (top left in navigation bar) > Select EC2\n",
    "2. Click \"Launch instance\"\n",
    "3. Select the most recent Amazon Linux AMI (Amazon Machine Image), it will have the format: Amazon Linux AMI 2016.09.1 (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-0b33d91d\n",
    "  - Most of the required programs will be installed and configured like pip, virtualenv\n",
    "4. Select the computer environment you want (free-tier includes a T2.Micro environment, for a full list of prices and compute environments see the [link](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/)) then \n",
    "5. Click \"Next: Configure Instance Details\" (defaults are ok)\n",
    "6. Click \"Next: Add Storage\" (defaults are ok unless you are planning on running the notebook up for a long time)\n",
    "7. Click \"Next: Add Tags\"\n",
    "  - Tag your instances\n",
    "  - Include key-value pairs that will help identify your instance\n",
    "  - Example \"Name: Jupyter Notebook\"\n",
    "8. Click \"Configure Security Groups\":\n",
    "  - You will next need to add 3 rules in addition to SSH\n",
    "  - Click the \"Add Rule\" button three times and select from the drop down menu the following:\n",
    "    a) SSH (included by default)\n",
    "    b) HTTP\n",
    "    c) HTTPS\n",
    "    d) Custom TCP Rule - set the port range to: 8888 (this is port through which you will be accessing Jupyter notebook)\n",
    " For added security you can set the source to \"My IP\", however statically ties to your EC2 instance to your IP-address (i.e. geographic location). \n",
    " I only suggest this if you know you're IP won't change/rotate.\n",
    "9. Click \"Review and Launch\"\n",
    "10. Click \"Launch\"\n",
    "11. You will be prompted to to use a key-pair value\n",
    "   - If you don't have a key-pair, create one. \n",
    "   - Make sure you store the key=pair somehwere secure since it is your key to access your EC2 instance.\n",
    "   - Name it something like `jupyter_nb.pem`\n",
    "12. Once you have downloaded your key-value pair click \"Launch Instance\"\n",
    "   - This will bring you to a user prompt window.\n",
    "   - By clicking \"View Instances\" at the bottom right of the screen you will be able to track your EC2s boot process\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations you've launched a virtual computer in the cloud!"

    "## Configuring your EC2 Instance to run Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "Once your EC2 has been you will need to change the permissions on your downloaded key so that you can tunnel into your cloud instance. You will then need to install software to run Jupyter-notebook in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changing your pem (security certificate) permissions \n",
    "_These instructions are for Mac, Ubuntu and Linux users._\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've downloaded you \".pem\" file you will need to secure the permissions. \n",
    "1. Navigate to the location where your \".pem\" file is located\n",
    "2. Use the command\n",
    "<code>chmod 400 your_pem_file.pem </code>\n",
    "  - <code>chmod</code> stands for \"Change Mode\"\n",
    "  - By setting the permissions 400 you are allowing read only an not writing \n",
    "  - This secures the file from changing it's value\n",
    "To check that the permission details have changed run <code>ls -la</code> and look for your \"*.pem\" file.\n",
    "You should see all the way on the right <code>-r--------</code> which indicates read access only.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logging on to your EC2 instance\n",
    "These instructions are for Mac, Ubuntu and Linux users. \n",
    "To log on to your EC2 istance you will need to record your \"IPv4 Public IP\" address, this will be located in your EC2 console.\n",
    "If you have navigated away from the webpage \"Services > EC2> Running Instances\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your public IP address logon using the code:\n",
    "<code> ssh -i ./your_pem_file.pem ec2-user@123.123.123 </code>\n",
    "\n",
    "The code above assumes you are in the same folder as your \"*.pem\" if not simply put the correct directory. \n",
    "Similarly replace the IP address 123.123.123 with your IPV4 Public IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note for Windows users\n",
    "For Windows instructions to change your pem permissions (using PuttyGen) and loggin-on to your EC2 instance (using Putty) see [here](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/116303/convert-amazon-pem-key-to-putty-ppk-key-linux) and [here] (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating your system\n",
    "These instructions are the same for Windows, Mac, Ubuntu and Linux users. \n",
    "Once logged in you will next want to set-up your environment this is made up of three steps:\n",
    "1. Updating your system and downloading appropriate files\n",
    "2. Configuring your system\n",
    "3. Modifying jupyter notebook configuration to run securely online (you don't want anyone to touch your files!)\n",
